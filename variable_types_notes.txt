There are 3 types of variables:

    1. Nominal
    2. Ordinal 
    3. Interval


Nominal Variable:
    Ex: Height of a person.

Ordinal Variable:
    Ex: Spiciness of a dish. There can be 3 values here:
        a) Mildly Spicy
        b) Spicy
        c) Very Spicy

    Assigning a value of 1, 2 and 3 to each of the 3 values does not accurately
    describe its meaning. (1 + 3) / 2 does not equal the value of 2, in this case.


Interval Variable:
    Ex: Number of cars present in a household. The values that the variable takes
        is in intervals of 1.
