There are 3 types of variables:

    1. Nominal
    2. Ordinal 
    3. Interval


Nominal Variable:
    Ex: Ethnicity of a person.

    Uses LabelEncoding where values between 0 and (n - 1) are generated.
    n is the number of types of labels available.

Ordinal Variable:
    Ex: Spiciness of a dish. There can be 3 values here:
        a) Mildly Spicy
        b) Spicy
        c) Very Spicy

    The values here aren't linear.

    Assigning a value of 1, 2 and 3 to each of the 3 values does not accurately
    describe its meaning. (1 + 3) / 2 does not equal the value of 2, in this case.

    Uses oneHotEncoding. The resulting encoding for the spiciness of a dish is:

    [[1, 0, 0],     # Mild
     [0, 1, 0],     # Spicy
     [0, 0, 1]]     # Very Spicy


Interval Variable:
    Ex: Number of cars present in a household. The values that the variable takes
        is in intervals of 1.
